WELCOME ABOARD!

Hi and welcome to the telluric project. We appreciate bug reports, questions
about documentation, and suggestions for new features. This issue template
isn't intended to ward you off -- only to intercept and redirect one particular
category of reports, and to collect a few important facts that issue reporters
often omit.

You think you've found something? We believe you.

Please note: telluric depends on packages that contain extension modules and
is thus susceptible to C library compatibility issues. If you are reporting
an installation or module import issue, please note that the problem might
lie outside of our project. The more information you provide, the quicker
we will find out where the problem is.
